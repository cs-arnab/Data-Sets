    abstract = "Regression modelling often presents a trade-off between predictiveness and interpretability. Highly predictive and popular tree-based algorithms such as Random Forest and boosted trees predict very well the outcome of new observations, but the effect of the predictors on the result is hard to interpret. Highly interpretable algorithms like linear effect-based boosting and MARS, on the other hand, are typically less predictive. Here we propose a novel regression algorithm, automatic piecewise linear regression (APLR), that combines the predictiveness of a boosting algorithm with the interpretability of a MARS model. In addition, as a boosting algorithm, it automatically handles variable selection, and, as a MARS-based approach, it takes into account non-linear relationships and possible interaction terms. We show on simulated and real data examples how APLR’s performance is comparable to that of the top-performing approaches in terms of prediction, while offering an easy way to interpret the results. APLR has been implemented in C++ and wrapped in a Python package as a Scikit-learn compatible estimator."

    abstract = {The unprecedented growth of computational capabilities in recent years has allowed Artificial Intelligence (AI) models to be developed for medical applications with remarkable results. However, a large number of Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) methods powered by AI have limited acceptance and adoption in the medical domain due to the typical blackbox nature of these AI models. Therefore, to facilitate the adoption of these AI models among the medical practitioners, the models' predictions must be explainable and interpretable. The emerging field of explainable AI (XAI) aims to justify the trustworthiness of these models' predictions. This work presents a systematic review of the literature reporting Alzheimer’s disease (AD) detection using XAI that were communicated during the last decade. Research questions were carefully formulated to categorise AI models into different conceptual approaches (e.g., Post-hoc, Ante-hoc, Model-Agnostic, Model-Specific, Global, Local etc.) and frameworks (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation or LIME, SHapley Additive exPlanations or SHAP, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping or GradCAM, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation or LRP, etc.) of XAI. This categorisation provides broad coverage of the interpretation spectrum from intrinsic (e.g., Model-Specific, Ante-hoc models) to complex patterns (e.g., Model-Agnostic, Post-hoc models) and by taking local explanations to a global scope. Additionally, different forms of interpretations providing in-depth insight into the factors that support the clinical diagnosis of AD are also discussed. Finally, limitations, needs and open challenges of XAI research are outlined with possible prospects of their usage in AD detection.},
